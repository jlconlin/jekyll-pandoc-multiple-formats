## Dependencies

* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).  Does most of the work converting
  Markdown to other formats.

* [Tectonic](https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/).  Recommended PDF
  engine for Pandoc.  Instead of installing the whole TeXLive
  distribution, Tectonic only downloads the packages required for your
  file.  It will also be used internally to generated imposition and
  binding formats.

* `pdfinfo` program provided by
  [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).  Only needed if you want
  to produce PDF.  Currently it's only used to figure out PDF page
  count. If you know of another way to reliably find PDFs page count,
  please let us know.

## Ready to go environment

If you're using Linux x86\_64, we recommend using
[haini.sh](https://0xacab.org/sutty/haini.sh).  It will install an
Alpine 3.13 distribution on a subdirectory and install pre-built gems
from <https://gems.sutty.nl/>.

After installing `haini.sh`, run this command to install missing
dependencies:

```bash
haini.sh apk add --no-cache pandoc tectonic poppler-utils
```

## Manual install

Install dependencies using your package manager of choice.  If they
provide too old versions (in comparison to the versions announced on
their webpages), you may be missing features or experience broken
builds, and you may need to install them via alternative sources
(download the binary, build from source, etc.)

We recommend [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) to prepare a Ruby 2.7
environment.

Some of the [gems](https://rubygems.org/) will need a working compiler
and some of your CPU time.  Depending on your operating system
distribution, you'll need to install development headers using your
package manager.

### Using Pacman package manager

```bash
# As root
pacman -Sy base-devel
```

### Using APT package manager

```bash
# As root
apt install build-essential
```
